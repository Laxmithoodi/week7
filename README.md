Steps to add a project to gitrepository from command Line
From command line
I think the following steps do the same thing from the command line, but it has been a while since I used them:

Create a new repository
create a new dir using command - mkdir
cd to your project directory e.g. cd projects/newproject
Run the following git commands
git init
git add .
 git commit -m “Initial commit”
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/projectname.git
